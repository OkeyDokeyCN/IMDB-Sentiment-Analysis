# IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis

## Introduction
In this project, I performed Sentiment Analysis on some IMDB movie reviews, build a movie classifier to classify the overall review as positive or negative.

This is useful in cases when the producer wants to measure its overall performance using reviews, also improve the quality of the movie by learning the unfavourable aspect of the movie.

The outcome of this project can also be used to create a recommendation system, by analyzing and categorizing the viewers’ opinion according to their preferences and interests, the system can predict which movie should be recommended, which one should not.

Another application of this project would be to find a group of viewers with similar movie tastes(likes or dislikes).

I explored serveral feature extraction techniques, for example Bag of Words and TF-IDF. For classification, I tried Random Forest Classifier and Naive Bayes. After tuning, I was able to predict the sentiment of movie with 93.56% accuracy with the combinatin of Bag of Words model and Random Forest Classifier.

## Data
I used two data sets from Kaggle.com.
